### Evaluation & Grading:

Progress in the course will be reﬂected in lab, quiz and exam grades covering the
subject areas of the course. Attendance in classes is expected. All exams and
quizzes will be taken via paper due to a plethora of cheating due to ChatGPT.

There will be no extra credit work given for any reason.
There will be no raising of letter grades at the end of the semester for any reason

| A- | 92.9 – 90 |
| B+ | 89.9 – 87.5 |
| B | 87.4 – 82.6 |
| B- | 82.5 – 80 |
| C+ | 79.9 – 77.5 |

| C- | 72.5 – 70 |
| D+ | 69.9 – 67.5 |
| D | 67.4 – 62.6 |
| D- | 62.5 – 60 |
| F | Below 60 |

### Labs:

Attendance in lab is mandatory. A laptop should be brought every lab. There are a few computers in the back of the lab if you are unable to bring one. A set of problems will be given each lab via Brightspace for you to complete after the lab quiz. When you are done with your lab, you must show your TA your work. It will be graded out of 2 points based on participation. Meaning, if it looks like you made an eﬀort and tried to solve the problems, you will receive the full 2 points. However, if it’s obvious you did not try, you will lose points. Solutions for the labs will be released on Fridays. DO THE LABS COMPLETELY. If you do well on them, you should do well on the exams. Ask for help from your TA when needed; they are there to help you!

### SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION:

Supplemental Instruction is a peer-led study group facilitated by a student that has taken and done well in the class previously and received additional training in study skills and group facilitation. Your SI Leader, Emily Herbert, facilitates two sessions per week based oﬀ of the material presented in class. Students that attend can ask questions, work through problems, review class material and work with other students in the class. Sessions are open to all students. Session times and locations can be
found by going to my.newpaltz.edu and then to the Center for Student Success tab. Signing up early is encouraged but walk-ins are also welcome.
