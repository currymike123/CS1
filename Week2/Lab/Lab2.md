# Lab 2

**Notes**

- Type all the programs from scratch. Do not copy and paste. It will help you to learn the syntax.
- If your program doesn't work on the first try don't worry. Debugging is a skill that you will develop over time.
- Remember to save and recompile every time you make a change to your program.
- If you get errors when you compile, go back and make sure you typed everything correctly. Proper capitalization, spelling, matching {}, etc.
- If you get stuck, ask your TA for help. That's what they are here for!

**Problems**

1. Create a program that prints your name to the console two times, once per line.
2. Create a program that prints your name to the console two times, on the same line.
3. Create a program that prints your name in a box:

```
+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
```

4. Write a program that prints "Welcome to Java" 3 times.
5. Write a program that displays the result of the equation below (Remember — Java follows PEMDAS).

6. Write a program that prints the summation of the following series:<br>
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9
7. <b>Factorial</b> is represented in math by the <b>!</b> symbol. For example, 4! = 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 24. Write a program that calculates the factorial of the number 7. <b>7!</b>
8. What do the following lines display? Do them on paper then check by compiling and running.<br>
   a. System.out.println(2+3);<br>
   b. System.out.println(“2”+3);<br>
   c. System.out.println(“2”+”3”);<br>
   d. System.out.println(1+2+3+”4”+5+6);<br>
   e. System.out.println(“2”+3+4);<br>
   f. System.out.println(“2”+(3+4));<br>
   Why do e and f display different results?<br>
   g. System.out.println(‘a’+1);<br>
   h. System.out.println(‘a’+”1”+’P’);

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

9. Using printf, write a program that displays the following table. There
   are 6 spaces between each column in the top row:

```
Employee      ID:      Hourly
Sally         12345    24.50
John          55555    19.32
Billy         34109    31.21
```

<br>
10) Write a program that saves the following information in variables and then prints it to the console:

```
Name: John Doe
Age: 20
Height: 5.11
```

John Doe, 20, and 5.11 should be saved in variables.
