                 How to Use see Version 3.0

Quick Start 

     see displays the contents of a file in hex and ASCII.  To 
use see, enter (on Windows or Mac) 

     see <filename>  (on Windows, if <filename> omitted, then prompted)

Use seerpi for Raspberry Pi, seelnx for Linux.
                                                             
see displays the contents of the input file one screenful at 
a time in hex and ASCII.  After each screen is displayed, 
see pauses for a user input, which can be: 

    q or Q        Quit pic.  
    n or N        Nonstop--continue without pauses.
    Hit ENTER     Display the next group of lines.

see does not assume any default file name extension. 


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
filenames on systems with case-sensitive filenames. 

     The format of the command line is

   see   <infilename>   -h   -l<lstfilename>   -a
                        -?   -n

Windows only: If <infilename> is specified on the command line, 
then see will not prompt the user for additional input.  In 
response to a prompt, the user can enter <infilename> and/or 
other command line arguments.  Prompting ends whenever the 
user enters <infilename>.  


If <infilename> is omitted, see prompts the user for it. 
If <infilename> starts with a pathname that starts with "/", then 
substitute "//" for the leading "/" in the pathname when entering 
<infilename>.  

-h or -? displays a help screen. 

If the -l argument is specified, screen output is written to the 
list file.  If <lstfilename> is specified with no extension, 
".see" is appended to it.  If -l is specified without 
<lstfilename>, then <lstfilename> defaults to 

     <infilename_less_extension>.see 

If -n is specified, a list file is not generated.  If neither the 
-l nor the -n arguments are specified, then the default setting 
is used (see the section "Default Settings" below).

If -a is specified, only ASCII text is displayed.  -a cancels the 
-l argument.
