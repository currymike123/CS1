Let’s say you are creating a web application for a dietitians’s office and
must have the ability to calculate daily protein needs for a patient. The
formula below is used to determine protein needs:<br><br>
<b>Protein Needs = weight in kilograms \* protein factor</b><br><br>
The following calculates a person’s protein factor:<br>
Normal Daily activity: 0.8gm/kg/day<br>
Moderate Daily physical activity: 1.2 gm/kg/day<br>
Heavy daily physical activity: 1.5 gm/kg./day

1. Use Scanner to ask a user for their weight in pounds. 1 pound is
   0.45359 kilograms.
2. Use Scanner to ask a user for their activity level. Users should enter
   1 for normal activity, 2 for moderate physical activity, and 3 for heavy
   physical activity.
3. Calculate the protein needs with the given information. Below is a
   sample run:

```bash
Enter your weight in pounds: 150

How active are you? Enter 1 for normal activity, 2 for moderate physical activity, and 3 for heavy physical activity: 2

Your protein needs are 81.4312 grams per day.
```
