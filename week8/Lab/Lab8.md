# Lab 8

1. Create a program with a method that prints your name every time it is called. Hint: This method does not return any values.

2. Create a program with a method that takes a `String` parameter and prints it. Print the `String` 5 times.

3. Create a program that prompts the user for a word, and then passes it to the method in question 2.

4. Create a program that prompts the user for an integer <b>n</b>, and then passes it to a method that calculates the sum of the first n numbers.

5. Create a program with a method that calculates the BMI of a person. The method should take two parameters: weight and height.<

- BMI = (weight / (height \* height)) \* 703

- Weight should be in pounds. Height should be in inches.

- The program should prompt the user for weight and height, and then pass these numbers to the method. The program should then display the BMI.

6. Create a program with a method that converts the time in seconds to
   days:hours:minutes:seconds.

- Example: input: 313297 seconds output: 3:15:1:37

- Have the return type be a `String` and print the result in the main method.

7. Create a program with a method that takes the right and left side of a triangle and returns the hypotenuse.

- The pythagorean theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

- <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the sides of the triangle. <i>c</i> is the hypotenuse.

8. Create a program that asks the user for their first and last name and saves them to two separate variables. Then pass them to a method that combines them into one `String` and returns it. Print the result in the main method.

9. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then passes it to a method that calculates the factorial of that number.

- Factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

- Example factorial of 5 is 5! = 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 120

10. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then passes it to a method that checks if the number is prime. The method should return a `boolean` value. Print the result in the main method.
