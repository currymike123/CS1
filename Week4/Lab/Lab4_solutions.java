         * 
         * (b) There is an if statement followed by else if statements. This structure 
         * means that as soon as one of the conditions is met, the corresponding block 
         * of code is executed, and the rest of the conditions are skipped. If x is less
         * than 5, it will print "x is less than 5" and then skip the rest of the checks.
         * If x is not less than 5 but is less than 10, it will print "x is less than 10"
         * and skip the remaining checks, and so on.
