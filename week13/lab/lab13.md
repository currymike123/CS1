## Lab 13

1. Create an Integer ArrayList in the main method.

2. Create a method that receives an integer that represents the size of an Integer ArrayList. The method should create an Integer ArrayList of the given size and fill it with random integers between 1 and 100. The method should return the ArrayList.

3. Create a method that that removes any value from the ArrayList that is less than 50. The method should return the ArrayList.

**Hint:** Structure your loop correctly so elements in the ArrayList are not skipped.

4. Call the previous methods (2,3) and print out the ArrayList before and after the values less than 50 are removed.

5. Create a program the prompts the user to enter times for a runner. The values should be saved as Doubles. You should have methods that find the fastest and slowest times. The program should print out the fastest and slowest times.

6. Add another ArrayList that saves the names of the runners. The program should print out the name of the runner with the fastest and slowest times.

**Hint:** Use the index to match the times with the names.

**Extra:** Try to create a 2D ArrayList to solve the problem. We haven't covered 2D ArrayLists, but you can try to figure it out.
